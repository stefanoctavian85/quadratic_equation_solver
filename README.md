# Quadratic Equation Solver

## Description
Quadratic Equation Solver is a simple console application developed in Assembly that helps users solve quadratic equations of the form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`. It calculates the roots of the equation using the quadratic formula and displays the results.

## Features
- Solves quadratic equations by calculating real and complex roots.
- Handles edge cases where coefficients result in no real solutions.
- User-friendly console interface for inputting coefficients.

## Installation
